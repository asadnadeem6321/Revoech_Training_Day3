## 📘 About This Repository

This repository serves as a reflection of my learning journey and practice in **Python programming**. Here, I've compiled my progress and exercises as I explored both the theoretical and practical aspects of Python.

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned

During my practice, I focused on building a solid foundation in Python by understanding and working with the following core concepts:

- **Variables and Data Types**  
- **Control Structures** (e.g., if-else, loops)  
- **Variable Scope**  
- **Arithmetic Operators**  
- **Comparison Operators**  
- **Logical Operators**

Each topic has been studied with a combination of reading, writing code, and hands-on problem-solving.

## 🛠️ Practice Files

I have attached my practice file(s) in this repository to showcase the work I’ve done while learning these concepts. These files include examples, exercises, and simple programs demonstrating my understanding.
